# Export Format Implementation

## Overview
This PR adds comprehensive export functionality to the Localizer tool. Users can now export localization data in three formats:
- Flutter (ZIP with Dart implementation)
- JSON (structured format)
- CSV (spreadsheet format)

## Changes
- Added new export utilities to the backend for JSON and CSV formats
- Created a modern UI for the export options with descriptive cards
- Implemented backend controllers for all export formats
- Connected frontend and backend with API endpoints
- Improved error handling and user experience with loading states

## Technical Details
- Backend uses models to fetch localization data
- JSON export provides a structured object with metadata
- CSV export includes headers and proper escaping for special characters
- Flutter export creates a complete implementation package

## Testing
Manual testing has been completed and confirmed working for all export formats:
- Flutter export produces a valid ZIP file with Dart implementation
- JSON export produces a well-structured JSON file
- CSV export produces a valid CSV file that can be imported into spreadsheet apps

## Screenshots
N/A (UI changes can be seen in the app after the PR is merged)
